#### This npc profile
just an ordinary npc and dumb in math, you can call me al sakha. i never imagined myself in the field of programming, but now focusing on website development. unemployed and not in college. i hope to stick with this career in the future.

i'm also learning editing, graphic design, and writing. loving cold or hot coffee while working and study. anyway, that's all about me and thank you.
